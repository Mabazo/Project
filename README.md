# Project
Predicting Income for Donors and Using Data to Further Understand our Donors
# Problem Statement
Predicting donation patterns and future contributions is a complex issue. Numerous internal and external influences on donors might cause irregularity and unpredictability in the act of giving. Without a data-driven, strategic approach to this problem, outreach attempts may be ineffective, resources may be misallocated, and relationships with potential high-value donors may not be developed. Like many other nonprofits, MAW UK is in need of a solution that would enable them to better understand their donors and anticipate potential future donations. As a result, the issue statement is as follows: How can MAW UK use data science and machine learning approaches to anticipate future behavior of donors, enabling more strategic resource allocation and improved donor engagement?
# Aims and Objectives
The primary objective of this life project is to create a data-driven model capable of predicting the potential lifetime contribution of new donors to Make A Wish UK, thereby aiding in the charity's financial planning and donor relationship management. The model will be integrated with a Power BI dashboard, providing an interactive platform for visualizing key insights and predictions.
Here are the specific objectives:
● To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends among donors.
● To develop predictive models for forecasting future donor behavior and income.
● To segment donors into different categories based on their donation history.
● To create an interactive dashboard to present the findings and insights.
# Scope of the Study
The study focuses on the donor data from MAW UK, encompassing donor information from 2016 to the present. The scope includes cleaning and preprocessing this data, performing an EDA, building a predictive model using machine learning, and integrating this model with a Power BI dashboard. Even though MAW UK is the focus of this study, other non-profit organizations can benefit from the techniques and conclusions reached.
